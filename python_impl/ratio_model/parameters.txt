# Probabilities of consecutive target-channel accesses and 
# non-target channel accesses. Each probability should be a fraction 
# number. The "i"th item in the comma separated list represents the
# probability of the "i"th access is a target-channel access when the
# previous "i-1" accesses are also target-channel accesses. And 
# similarly for non-target-channel accesses.
# "ca" represents target-channel accesses, and "cn" represents non-
# target-channel accesses.
