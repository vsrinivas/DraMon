This directory has the python implementation of the DraMon model. This 
implementation is used when I was exploring how to consider various hardware and 
software factors in DraMon. Besides the model presented in HPCA paper, this 
implementation has more options and allows consideration of more factors. 
Therefore, it should be very helpful to people who try to use DraMon on their 
own machines. Plus, python code is much easier to understand and change. 

Good luck!
