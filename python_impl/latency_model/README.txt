This directory contains files of the hit/miss/conflict (HMC) latencies 
prediction part of the DraMon model. 

The "gen_latencies.py" file is the user-interface, the lateny_model.py is the 
actual model. Run "gen_latencies.py" with --help to get information about how 
to use the model, i.e., passing parameters.
